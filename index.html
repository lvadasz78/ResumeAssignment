       <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>
        <p class="body">My name is Lori Vadasz (pronounced Vey-Dez). I am in my third semester of Graphic Design courses. I am working on getting my Associates Degree from Wake Technical Community College.
        I am a very creative person and have a passion for abstract and unusal work. I enjoy working with bright colors, unique designs and people.</p>

          <h3>Promotional Postcard</h3>
          <p>For this project, I chose items that I used or inspired me to be a designer.  A few items I used were my dog's chew bone, my digital art pad, a lilly (my favorite flower), and my son's hand. For the design style, I used a "Grunge" style, using the book BadA Effects by Corey Barker. I then brightened the colors of the collage image and used a filter to look like plastic wrap, to make it appear the item was being thrown down onto purple paint, creating the splash effect.  I then used some bevel designs for my name to make it stick out.</p>

            <h3>Promotional Postcard</h3>
            <p>For this project, I asked my friend's daughters if they would be models and they agreed.  I had them sit back to back and then took different images of sections of them at a time.  I started at the top left and worked all the way down.  I then chose pieces of images that contrasted well together and slowly put them together to create this beautiful collage.</p>
