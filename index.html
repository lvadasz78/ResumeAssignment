         <p class="graphic"><img src="images/vdesign.jpg" alt="Grunge style collage with purple paint splatters L V Designs Unique Creative Fun" style="width: 150px"></p>
          <p class="graphic">For this project, I chose items that I used or inspired me to be a designer.<br> A few items I used were my dog's chew bone, my digital art pad, a lilly (my favorite flower), and my son's hand.</p>
          <p class="graphic">For the design style, I used a "Grunge" style, using the book BadA Effects by Corey Barker.<br>  I then brightened the colors of the collage image and used a filter to look like plastic wrap,<br> to make it appear the item was being thrown down onto purple paint, creating the splash effect.<br>  I then used some bevel designs for my name to make it stick out.</p>
