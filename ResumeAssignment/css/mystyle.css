          <h3>Promotional Postcard</h3>
          <img src="images/vdesign.jpg" alt="Grunge style collage with purple paint splatters L V Designs Unique Creative Fun" style="width: 150px">
          <p>For this project, I chose items that I used or inspired me to be a designer. A few items I used were my dog's chew bone, my digital art pad, a lilly (my favorite flower), and my son's hand.</p>
          <p>For the design style, I used a "Grunge" style, using the book BadA Effects by Corey Barker.  I then brightened the colors of the collage image and used a filter to look like plastic wrap, to make it appear the item was being thrown down onto purple paint, creating the splash effect.  I then used some bevel designs for my name to make it stick out.</p>
